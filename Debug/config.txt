###### Gabor params ######
#gabor_setting...[0-off, 1-only gabor]
#gabor_points... maximum number of points in image, could be lower depending on filter specification
    #center of histograms
#gabor_histogram_size... pixel size of histogram n x n
#gabor_border_size... pixel border from each side of an image which not contains any points
#uniformity is taken from LBP or LBPa settings, when is gabor set to "only gabor" then grid size has no meaning

###### S-LBP params ######
#slbp_grid_size... n * n subhistograms [1-16]
#slbp_uniform... uniform or not uniform patterns [1|0]
#slbp_range... distance between center point and circle interpolated neighbours [1-3]
            # setting range to 1 means standard LBP
#slbp_neighbours... number of neighbours, for uniform patterns [8-16]
            # !!! for not uniform patterns should be lower than 12 (histograms are too big) !!!
#slbp_neighbour_shape... shape of neighbour pixel group see "shapes.txt" [1-5]
            # set 1 for default one pixel version

###### E-LBP params ######
#elbp_center_size... defines n*n size of center [1-3]
#elbp_neighbour_shape... same as in LBP but there should be values [2|3] but works with any other shape
#elbp_range... range between center and center of shapes

#Gabor [NORMAL MODE]
gabor_setting:1
gabor_points:100
gabor_histogram_size:10
gabor_border_size:10

#S-LBP [NORMAL MODE]
